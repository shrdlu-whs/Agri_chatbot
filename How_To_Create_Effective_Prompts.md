## How to Use the Agricultural Chatbot Effectively

A well-crafted prompt ensures the chatbot understands your situation and provides accurate, practical advice. Follow these tips to make your questions clear, relatable, and specific to your agricultural needs.

### Tips for Asking Questions

**1. Be Specific**

Include details like the type of crop, location, or time of year. This helps the chatbot give targeted recommendations.

    What’s the best way to grow maize in a rainy area?

**2. Keep Questions Simple and Focused**

Avoid combining too many topics into one question. Direct, clear queries work best.

    Which fertiliser works best for tomatoes?

**3. Include Measurements or Numbers**

Mention areas, quantities, or timelines to make your question more actionable.

    How much water do I need for 1 acre of rice?

**4. Mention Growth Stages or Timelines**

If the crop has distinct stages (e.g., planting, growing, or harvest), include this.

    What pests attack wheat during the flowering stage?

**5. Describe Problems in Detail**

Explain symptoms, when they started, and what’s affected.

    My maize leaves are turning yellow—what could be wrong?

**6. Ask for Solutions within Limits**

If you have a budget or resource constraints, mention them.

    How can I manage pests on a small budget for soybeans?

**7. Add Local Context**

Highlight your location or climate conditions to make the advice more relevant.

    What crops grow well in sandy soil in Southern Europe?

### Combining the Tips for a Successful Prompt

Here’s an example that brings it all together:

    I’m growing tomatoes in Southern Europe, and
    the leaves are turning yellow during the flowering
    stage. What could be causing this, and how can I fix it on a small budget?

This question works because:

    - It’s specific (mentions tomatoes, yellowing leaves,
      and flowering stage).
    - It explains the problem clearly.
    - It includes local context (Southern Europe).
    - It asks for affordable solutions.

Using these tips, you’ll get better, more practical answers from your agricultural chatbot!
